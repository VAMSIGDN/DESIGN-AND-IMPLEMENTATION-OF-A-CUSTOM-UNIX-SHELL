# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-A-CUSTOM-UNIX-SHELL
This project builds a custom UNIX shell using C, designed to show how a real command-line interface works behind the scenes. It takes user input, processes commands, runs programs using system calls like fork() and exec(), and handles basic built-in commands, helping users understand UNIX process management in a practical way.
